# Steam Game Scraper Script

This script allows you to automatically scrape the names of all games from your Steam library including all family library games. After it finishes scraping it will save all your games into a .txt file and download it.

## How to use it

1. Open <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/familymanagement?tab=library" target="_blank">THIS</a> Steam page in your browser(you can also navigate to this page by clicking on your avatar > account details > Family Management > Library). Now you should see the list of all your games including family shared one.
